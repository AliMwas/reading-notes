## HTML Links
HTML links are hyperlinks.

You can click on a link and jump to another document. When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

HTML Links - Syntax
The HTML < a > tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:

< a href="link">press here < /a>

The most important attribute of the < a > element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination. The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

Clicking on the link text will send the reader to the specified URL address.
HTML Links - The target Attribute
By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

* self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
* blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
* parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
* top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

HTML Links: Use an Image as a Link
To use an image as a link, just put the < img > tag inside the < a > tag.

## Layout

How to control the position of each element on the page and how to create an attractive page layout. This involves learning how to design for screens is different from designing for other media such as prints.

The CSS building block treats each HTML element as if it were in its own box. This box will be either a block level box or an inline box. Block-level boxes start with a new line and act as the main building block of any layout, while inline boxes flow through the surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the box width (and sometimes height). To separate the boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.

## Functions in JS

Functions A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" evokes it (calls it).

JavaScript Function Syntax
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

Function Invocation
The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
Automatically (self invoked)

Function Return
When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":

## pair programming

Although there are many different styles, peer-to-peer programming usually involves two roles: the controller and the browser. The controller is the programmer who types and is the only programmer who puts his hands on the keyboard. By processing the "mechanism" of coding, the controller manages the text editor, changes files, controls versions, and of course writes code. The navigator uses your words to guide the driver, but it does not provide any direct input to the computer. The navigator will consider the big picture, what will happen next, and how to convert the algorithm into code when looking for spelling errors or errors. Navigators can also use their computer as a second screen to find solutions and documents, but they don't have to write any code.
