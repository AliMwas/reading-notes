# Build the Perfect Team


Psychological safety-everyone feels that it is safe to take risks with team members and they will not be embarrassed or punished for it. 


 Reliability-everyone can complete high-quality work on time. 


 Structure and clarity: Everyone knows what your specific expectations are. These expectations should be challenging, but achievable. 


 Meaning: Everyone has a sense of purpose at work (ie, financial security, family support, helping the team succeed, etc.). 


 Impact: Everyone sees that the results of their work really help achieve the overall goals of the organization. 

 Cultivate strategic thinking. Understand and understand what drives the company to success.


 Be famous for something. Do you have a lot of experience in related fields? (That is, financial acumen, scientific experience, and even highly specialized knowledge, such as tax law or merger accounting.) Master them proactively. 


 Practice solving complex problems. This is especially useful for the complicated interview questions that Google is famous for.
 
  Use these linear thinking skills to your advantage as you dig deeper into the problem.

  If you’re left brained:

Develop learning agility- Instead of defaulting to the “tried and true” (which pragmatists tend to do), be open to trying varied approaches and new ideas.


Find joy in ambiguity- Practice coping with uncertainty and making decisions without having all the information beforehand.


Put your social leadership skills to the test- When was the last time you motivated influenced others or deeply connected with your teammates? You might come to find that you actually enjoy it.
