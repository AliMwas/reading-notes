# summary of HTML
**wireframes**

Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers to allow them to define and plan the information hierarchy of a website, application, or product design. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants users to handle the information on the website, based on user research that the user experience design team has completed.

**HTML - Hypertext Markup Language**

 HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the most basic component of the Web. Define the meaning and structure of the web content. Technologies other than HTML are often used to describe the appearance/performance (CSS) or the function/behavior (JavaScript) of a web page.
 
 **Semantics in HTML**

 For example, in HTML, an element is a semantic element that gives you the function (or meaning) of the surrounding text "top page title".

 semantic examples in HTML:

* article
* aside
* details
* footer
* header
* main
* nav
