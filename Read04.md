# Summary of JavaScript

JavaScript, generally abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. 

JavaScript is high-level, generally compiled by Justintime, and multi-paradigm. It has brace syntax, dynamic writing, first-class functions, and prototype-based object-oriented.

This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, not to parts specific to web pages or other host environments. For information about specific APIs for web pages, see DOM and Web API.

**There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:**

* Using var
* Using let
* Using const

Variables are containers for storing data (values).

In this example, A, B, and C, are variables, declared with the var keyword:

Example
* var A = 10;  A stores the value 10

* var B = 9;  B stores the value 9

* var C = A + B;   C stores the value 19

### JavaScript Data Types

JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 58 and text values like "Ali".

In programming, text values are called text strings.

JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.
