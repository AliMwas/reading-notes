SQL vs. NoSQL
What kind of data is suitable for a SQL database?

Conventional SQL-based databases are the greatest match if your data is well organized and relationships across program elements are clearly specified (for example, if you're creating a point-of-sale system that has to hold customer orders and product information).



What kind of data is suitable for a NoSQL database?

Molecular modeling data, geospatial data, and satellite data are all very unstructured. Similarly, data from social media analysis and websites is extremely unstructured, with no obvious links between data items. In some cases, NoSQL is a superior option.

Which database is better for storing hierarchical data?

MongoDB and Redis, both document-based databases, are ideal for small-scale hierarchical data with a small number of children per entry.



Which database type is the most scalable?

SQL databases are vertically scalable in the vast majority of cases. On a single server, you may handle the rising demand by upgrading the CPU, RAM, SSD, and other components. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are horizontally scalable. To manage the increased demand, just add a couple of extra servers to your NoSQL database system.
