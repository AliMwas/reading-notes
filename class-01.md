# Introductory HTML and JavaScript


**Introduction about HTML**

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup system for creating hypertext documents that can be ported from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with general semantics and are suitable for representing information from various applications. HTML tags can represent hypertext news, emails, documents, and hypermedia; option menus; database query results; simple structured documents with online graphics; and hypertext views of the main body of information.


**Structure of HTML**

The basic parts of a 
 document web page can and look completely different from each other, but they all tend to share similar standard components, unless the page displays the video or game in full screen and is part of a certain video project. Or just poor structure: 
 Title: 
 Usually there is a big stripe on the top with a good title, logo, and maybe a slogan. Usually, this stays the same from one page to another. 
 Navigation Bar: 
 links to the main part of the website; usually represented by a menu button, link or tab. Like the title, this content is usually consistent from one page to another; inconsistent navigation on your website will only cause confusion and frustration for users. Many web designers think that the navigation bar is part of the title rather than a separate component, but this is not necessary; in fact, some people also think that separating the two is better for accessibility, because if you separate them, the screen The reader can read these two functions better. 
 maincontent - A large area in the center of 
 that contains most of the unique content of a given web page, for example the video you want to watch, or the main story you are reading, or the map you want to see, or news headlines, etc. This is part of the website and will definitely vary from page to page! 
 Sidebar: 
 Some peripheral information, links, references, advertisements, etc. Usually this is related to the content of the main content (for example, on a news article page, the sidebar may contain the author's introduction or link to related articles), but there are also cases where you will find some recurring elements, such as the auxiliary navigation system. 
 Footer: 
 The band at the bottom of the page usually contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact information. This is a place to put public information (such as headlines), but generally the information is not important or secondary to the website itself. Footers are also sometimes used for SEO purposes, providing links to quickly access popular content.


**HTML5 Layout**

 HTML design element 
 HTML has several semantic elements that define different parts of a web page: 
 HTML5 semantic element 
 Defines the title of a document or section 
 Defines a set of navigation links 
 Defines parts in a document 
 Defines independent and independent content 
 Defines other than content Content (such as sidebar) 
 Defines the footer of a document or section 
 Defines other details that the user can open and close on demand 
 Defines the title of the element 
 
**Introduction about JS**

 JavaScripts is a cross-platform, object-oriented programming language used to make web pages interactive (for example, with complex animations, clickable buttons, pop-up menus, etc.). There are also more advanced versions of JavaScript on the 
 server, such as Node.js, which allows you to add more features to your website than downloading files (such as real-time collaboration between multiple computers). In a host environment (such as a web browser), JavaScript can connect to objects in the environment to provide programmatic control over them. 
 JavaScript includes a standard object library, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a set of basic language elements, such as operators, control structures, and declarations. The main JavaScript can be extended for various purposes by adding additional objects
