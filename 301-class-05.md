# Putting it all together


## React Docs - Thinking in React

**What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?** 

The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer-programming principle that states that every module, class, or function in a computer program should have responsibility for a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part.

**What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?**
Static applications and websites render in the user's browser without the need for server-side processing, this means that all the rendering of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is done on the client-side, rather than relying on server-side technologies.

 **Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?**

Add Inverse Data Flow.
we’ve identified what the minimal set of app states is. Next, we need to identify which component mutates, or owns, this state.


**What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is a state?**

Is it props-passed in from a parent?
Does it stay the same throughout time?
Is it possible to calculate it using any other state or props in your component?

 **How can you identify where the state needs to live?**

1) Choose each component that shows anything in response to that state. 
2) Locate a component with a shared owner (one component above all components that need state in the hierarchy).
 3) It must be held by either the co-owner or a higher state hierarchy element. 
4) If you can't find a component that makes sense to own the state, build a new one to maintain the state exclusively and place it above the co-owner component in the hierarchy.

## Higher-Order Functions

**What is a “higher-order function”?**
In Javascript, functions can be assigned to variables in the same way that strings or arrays can. They can be passed into other functions as parameters or returned from them as well. A “higher-order function” is a function that accepts functions as parameters and/or returns a function.


**Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?**
Determine if two integers are true or false by comparing them.


**Explain how either map or to reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.**

The map method transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and then constructing a new array from the results. The resulting array will be the same length as the input array, but the function will have translated the information to a different form.
