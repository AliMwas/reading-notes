##Remote repository 

 To collaborate on a Git project, you must interact with a remote repository, online, or web version of the project. You can use multiple repositories and you can have read/write or read-only permissions. Teams can use remote repositories to submit information and extract data from it. 
 Cloning a repository 
 As mentioned above, to clone a repository, Git will automatically assign the name "origin" to the server you cloned from and the name "main" to its local branch.

 **Example of using git**

 *Seeing the Remotes: git remote
 *Adding Remotes:git remote
 *Pushing:git push origin main
 *Renaming:git remote rename
 *Removing:git remote rm"name"
 *Creating a New Branch:git branch
