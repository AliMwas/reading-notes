# APIs


## API Design Best Practices

**What does REST stand for?**

REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.

**REST APIs are designed around a ____.**
resource

**What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example.**

The URI uniquely identifies this resource. For example, the URI requested by a specific client could be: HTTP

https:/adventure-works.com/orders/1

**What are the most common HTTP verbs?**
The primary or most commonly used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called) are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.


**What should the URIs be based on?**

The resource URI should be based on nouns (resources) rather than verbs (operations on resources).

**Give an example of a good URI.**

**What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?**

The reason why chatty APIs are considered poor quality is because requiring multiple network calls will slow down an application. This is because each call contains data overhead (i.e. sender information, headers, authentication) which will slow down an application as well as network latency per each request.


**What status code does a successful GET request return?**

Returns HTTP status code 200 (OK).

**What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?**

If the resource cannot be found, the method should return 404 (Not Found).

**What status code does a successful POST request return?**


Returns HTTP status code 201 (Created).

**What status code does a successful DELETE request return?**

It returns an HTTP status code 204
