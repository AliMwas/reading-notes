## State and Props

### React lifecycle
1) Based on the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
The render happens first then the componentDidMount.

2) What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
Constructor().

3) Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates

1. constructor
2. render
3. React Updates
4. componentDidMount
5. componentWillUnmount

4) What does componentDidMount do?
The componentDidMount() method allows us to execute the React code when the component is already placed in the DOM (Document Object Model). This method is called during the Mounting phase of the React Life-cycle i.e after the component is rendered.

1) What types of things can you pass in the props?
What Are Props? Props (aka "properties") in React allow us to pass values from a parent component down to a child component. The values can be any data type, from strings to functions, objects, etc

2) What is the big difference between props and state?

The key difference between props and state is that state is internal and controlled by the component itself while props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component

3) When do we re-render our application?
React components automatically re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props. A simple update of the state, from anywhere in the code, causes all the User Interface (UI) elements to be re-rendered automatically. However, there may be cases where the render() method depends on some other data.
