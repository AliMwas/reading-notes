# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

## Functional Programming Concepts

**What is functional programming?**

functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

**What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**

The function always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed in. It does not depend on any state, or data, change during a program's execution. It must only depend on its input arguments.

**What are the benefits of a pure function?**

One of the major benefits of using pure functions is they are immediately testable. They will always produce the same result if you pass in the same arguments. They also make maintaining and refactoring code much easier.

**What is immutability?**

 an immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. This is in contrast to a mutable object, which can be modified after it is created

**What is Referential transparency?**

Referential transparency and referential opacity are properties of parts of computer programs. An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior.


## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

**What is a module?**

Module in Node.js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node.js application.

**What does the word ‘require’ do?**

to import data 

**How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

We can do this by using the word require and providing the module's path.

**What do we have to do to make a module available?**

By exporting module functionalities, you can gain access to them. This is accomplished using the export statement.
