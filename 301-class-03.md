## React Docs - lists and keys
1. What does .map() return?
In React, the map() function is most commonly used for rendering a list of data to the DOM.
To use the map() function, attach it to an array you want to iterate over. The map() function expects a callback as the argument and executes it once for each element in the array.

2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
Showing a list of items is crucial in every single application we'll build. Using JSX we can show lists using JavaScript's built-in Array.map() method.

The .map() is often used to take one piece of data and convert it to another. In our scenarios, we are taking data and converting it to a piece of our view.

3. Each list item needs a unique __key__.

4. What is the purpose of a key?
keys() method is used to return an array whose elements are strings corresponding to the enumerable properties found directly upon an object. The ordering of the properties is the same as that given by the object manually in a loop is applied to the properties.

### What is the spread operator?
JavaScript, spread syntax refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots (…) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.

### List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
the spread operator is useful for many different routine tasks in JavaScript, including the following:
Copying an array
Concatenating or combining arrays
Using Math functions
Using an array as arguments
Adding an item to a list
Adding to state in React
Combining objects
Converting NodeList to an array
In each case, the spread syntax expands an iterable object, usually an array, though it can be used on any iterable, including a string.

### Concatenating arrays
Asseen in the last example, the spread operator can quickly combine two arrays, an operation known as array concatenation:

const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩

### Spread operator to add a new item to an array, Example:
const fewMoreFruit = [‘🍉’, ‘🍍’, …fewFruit]

const fewFruit = [‘🍏’,’🍊’,’🍌’]

### Spread operator to combine two objects into one, Example:
const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
