# Readings: React and Forms

### React Docs - Forms
**What is a ‘Controlled Component’?**

A controlled component is a component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the component's state. In a controlled component, the form element's data is handled by the React component (not DOM) and kept in the component's state.

**Should we wait to store the user's responses from the form into the state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.**

In the second case, where React is in charge of preserving and setting its state, both of them will function. The state is kept in sync with the value of the input, which means that changing the input changes the state, and changing the state changes the input.



**How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?**

We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.

### The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

**Why would we use a ternary operator?**

A ternary operator allows you to assign one value to the variable if the condition is true, and another value if the condition is false. ... A ternary operator makes the assignment of a value to a variable easier to see, because it's contained on a single line instead of an if-else block.

 **Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:**
 

    if(x===y){
    console.log(true);
    } else {
    console.log(false);
    }

> console.log(x===y ? 'true' : 'false');
