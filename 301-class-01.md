## Things I want to know more about

### What is a Component?
A component is a well-defined collection of modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable functionality that wraps and exports its implementation as a higher-level interface.

A component is a software object that encapsulates specific functionality or a collection of functions and is designed to interact with other components. It has a well-defined interface and follows a suggested behavior that other components in architecture should follow.

### What are the characteristics of a component?
Characteristics of Components
Reusability Components are often intended to be reused in a variety of settings and applications. Some components, on the other hand, maybe tailored to a specific purpose.

Components that are replaceable can be swapped out for others that are comparable.

It is not context-specific. Components are made to work in a variety of settings and situations.

Extensible: A component's behavior may be expanded by combining it with that of other components.

an encapsulated A component shows the interfaces that allow the caller to access its functionality, but it does not reveal any underlying processes, variables, or states.
Independent Components are created with the goal of having as little dependencies as possible on other components.

### What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
Ease of deployment As new compatible versions become available, it becomes easier to update older versions without affecting other components or the system as a whole.

Reduced costs Using third-party components help you to stretch the expense of development and maintenance out over a longer period of time.

Components use well-known interfaces to offer defined functionality, allowing development to take place without affecting other elements of the system.

Reusable components allow developers and system administrators to distribute development and maintenance costs across several applications or systems.

### What is Props?
React is a component-based framework that breaks down the user interface into smaller, reusable chunks. In some situations, those components may need to communicate (transfer data to one another), and the best method to do so is to use props.

### How are props used in React?
Step-by-step instructions on how to utilize props will be provided.
To begin, specify an attribute and its value(data). Then, using Props, give it to the child component(s).
Last but not least, render the Props. Data


### What is the flow of props?
Adding Flow types to your React components is incredibly powerful. After typing your component, Flow will statically ensure that you are using the component in the way it was designed to be used.

Early in Reactâ€™s history, the library provided PropTypes which performed basic runtime checks. Flow is much more powerful as it can tell you when you are misusing a component without running your code.

There are some Babel plugins that will generate PropTypes from Flow types such as babel-plugin-react-flow-props-to-prop-types if you want both static and runtime checks.
