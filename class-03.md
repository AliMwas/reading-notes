# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

**HTML lists allow Web developers to group a set of related items into lists.**
 1. Unordered list HTML list 
 The unordered list starts with the tag. Each item in the list begins with the label By default, list items will have bullets (small black circles).
 2. Ordered HTML List 
 List Sorting starts with the tag. Each item in the list starts with the label By default, list items will be marked with numbers.
 3. Description list HTML 
 HTML also supports description lists. Tag defines the description list, tag defines the term (name), and tag describes each term.
 
 HTML List Tags
* Tag	Description
* < ul >	Defines an unordered list
* < ol >	Defines an ordered list
* < li >	Defines a list item
* < dl >	Defines a description list
* < dt >	Defines a term in a description list
* < dd >	Describes the term in a description list

CSS 
 Box Model In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about layout and design. The CSS 
 box model is essentially a box wrapped around each HTML element. Includes margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The following figure illustrates the box model:

**USING QUOTES INSIDE A STRING**

 Sometimes you will want to use single or double quotes in a string. 
 Because the string can be enclosed in single or double quotes, if you only want to use double quotes in the string, you can enclose the entire string in single quotes. 
 If you only want to use single quotes in a string, you can enclose the string in double quotes (as shown in the third line of this code example). 
 You can also use a technique called escape quote characters. This is done 
 by using a backslash (or "backslash") before any type of quotation mark 
 that appears in the string 
 (as shown in the fourth line of this code sample). 
 The backslash tells the interpreter that the next character is part of the string, not the end of the string.

**USING A VARIABLE TO STORE A BOOLEAN**

Use true or false values ​​in the class attributes of HTML elements. These values ​​trigger different CSS class rules: true shows a check mark, false shows passed. The value can only be true/false. You can also think of these values ​​as on/off or 0/1: true is equivalent to on or 1, and false is equivalent to off or 0. Secondly, use boolean values ​​when your code can take multiple paths. Remember that different codes can run in different situations.

**CHANGING THE VALUE OF A VARIABLE**
 
 After assigning a value to a variable, you can change the content stored in the variable later in the same script. After you create a variable, you don’t need to use the var keyword to assign a new value to it. Just use the variable name, the equal sign (also known as the assignment operator), and the new value of the attribute.

 **Switch statement**

 The switch  statement begins with a variable called the switch  value. Each case represents the possible value of this variable and the code to be executed if the variable matches that value. Here, the variable called level is exchange value. If the value of the variable eve 1 is the string One, the code of the first case is executed. If it is Two, the second case is executed. If it is three, the third case is executed. If neither is the case, the code of the default case is executed. 
 The complete statement is in a code block (a set of braces). If the case matches the changed value, the colon separates the option from the statement to be executed. At the end of each case is the break keyword. It tells the JavaScript interpreter that you have completed the switch statement and continue to execute any subsequent code that appears after it.
